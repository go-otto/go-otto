👋 Hi, I’m Jimmy
🛠️ I build tools so humans can do less clicking and more thinking.  
📚 Currently DevOps, but miss NetEng.  
🤝 Let’s collaborate! Especially if your idea breaks before it scales.  
📬 Best way to reach me? Open an issue. Second best? Try email.

go-otto/go-otto is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
