Hi, I’m Jimmy
I build tools so humans can do less clicking and more thinking.  
Currently DevOps, but miss NetEng.  
Let’s collaborate! Especially if your idea breaks before it scales.  
Best way to reach me? Open an issue. Second best? Try email.

go-otto/go-otto is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
